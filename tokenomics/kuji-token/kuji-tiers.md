# 🥇 Staking Tiers and Symbols on BLUE, FIN, and ORCA

If you are a user of Kujira's BLUE, FIN, or ORCA apps, you may have noticed some symbols located at the top right corner of each app. <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

These symbols are tied to the amount of KUJI that a user has staked across all Kujira validators on the mainnet. Specifically, the symbols will light up as follows:

* The leftmost symbol will light up when a user has staked 500 KUJI or more.
* The middle symbol will light up when a user has staked 5000 KUJI or more.
* The rightmost symbol will light up when a user has staked 50000 KUJI or more.

So what do these symbols represent? That's currently a mystery - the team at Kujira has not yet revealed the significance of these symbols. However, it is worth noting that these are not the only symbols that may appear in the future. Stay tuned for updates from Kujira on this front.&#x20;
