# Discord

The Kujira Discord is a community hub that offers many channels for various types of activity. It can be accessed at [https://discord.gg/teamkujira](https://discord.gg/teamkujira). Along with Telegram, Discord is the primary way to:

$$\bullet$$ Directly communicate with the team (and experienced & friendly chat moderators)

&#x20;$$\bullet$$ Ask for technical support&#x20;

$$\bullet$$ Make polite requests or recommendations for new features or modifications&#x20;

$$\bullet$$ Engage with the community in a more informal setting&#x20;

$$\bullet$$ Receive the latest announcements from the team before they are released elsewhere

To request support on Discord, you can create a Support Ticket in the #help channel. It's important to note that on Discord (as with many crypto projects), there are often scammers who impersonate team members and moderators in an attempt to hack users through social engineering. Team members and moderators will always have the roles "Team," "Admin," "Moderator," or "Community Moderator" next to their names when sending messages in any of the Kujira Discord channels. If a team member or moderator asks you to private message them, _**it's generally recommended that you message them first after they request it in one of the main chats**_, as imposters may still try to message you privately to deceive you.&#x20;

### Roles

The Kujira Discord uses roles to group community members and assign different permissions. To participate in the Discord, you will need to go through a simple verification process. You may need to temporarily enable direct messages from unknown accounts as part of this process.
