# 📰 How to Provide Incentives

* Navigate to [bow.kujira.app](https://bow.kujira.app/)
* Connect on the top right to your Keplr or Sonar wallet by clicking the connect wallet button and selecting the corresponding wallet (Keplr or Sonar)
* Click the Pools button on the top left
* ATOM/USK is one of the featured pools. A longer list of all liquidity pools is located at the bottom of the page. Navigate to the ATOM/USK pool and click on it
* Next, on the top right, under the listed ‘Incentives’, click ‘Incentivize this pool

* Next, under ‘Select the Incentive Token and Total Amount’ scroll through and select the token that you would like to provide as an incentive (rewards for others) to the liquidity pool
* Then enter the amount of the chosen token that you would like to provide to the ATOM/USK BOW LP

* Next, select a Distribution Start and End date to control the distribution rate of the provided incentives
* Next, select the Incentive type. Decreasing linearly decreases the amount of provided rewards over time–whereas fixed provides the same amount of daily rewards across the entire distribution period
* Next, toggle both acknowledgements to confirm that you understand this incentivizing is a one-way transaction, with any submitted tokens being distributed to LP stakers–and that incentivizing incurs a fee of 10 USK
* Finally, click the blue ‘Incentivise Pool’ button and pay gas fees to finish the process
