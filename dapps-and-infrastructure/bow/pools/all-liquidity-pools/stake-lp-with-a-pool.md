# 🍵 Stake LP with a Pool

## Overview

The 'Stake' tab for each liquidity pool contains a user interface for staking and unstaking liquidity and data on total personal provided liquidity, amount of unstaked personal LP tokens, current unclaimed staking rewards, and current pool incentives in addition to the basic header contained in the 'Overview', 'Provide', and 'Stake' pages).

## Personal LP status

This section near the top under the basic header reflects total personal current LP token balance and displays the amount of unstaked LP tokens in red as well as any unclaimed staking rewards (from pool incentives) in white. The reward breakdown displays the amount of each token earned from staking the LP tokens since last claimed.&#x20;

## Stake LP tokens

Simply enter the amount of LP tokens you would like to stake with BOW. The staking process is near instant. Staking rewards are automatically claimed any time LP tokens are staked.&#x20;

## Unstake LP tokens

Simply enter the amount of LP tokens you would like to unstake with BOW. The unstaking process is near instant. There is zero lockup of LP tokens. Staking rewards are automatically claimed any time LP tokens are unstaked.&#x20;

## Additional Incentives

This section of the page displays the liquidity pool's active incentive release schedules via various charts. These release schedules can be used to infer the amount of incentives releasing on a daily basis over a certain period of time. Read this [section](pool-overview.md#incentive-release-charts) to understand how to interpret these charts.&#x20;
