# 📰 How to Stake any Cosmos Layer 1 Token

* Navigate to [pod.kujira.app](https://pod.kujira.app/)
* Connect on the top right to your Keplr or Sonar wallet by clicking the connect wallet button and selecting the corresponding wallet (Keplr or Sonar)
* Next, at the top right, select the corresponding chain to the native token that you would like to stake by scrolling through the list
* If you would like to stake this token to earn staking rewards, you must delegate it to someone already in the active set

* If you are comfortable with your choices, select the gray ‘Confirm’ button and pay gas fees to finish staking your ‘Token’. (This will also automatically claim any previously unclaimed staking rewards)
* If you are unsatisfied with the validator selection and would like to select validators to stake with manually, navigate to the top right and select ‘Cancel Selection’. Next, click on any individual validator of interest
* If you would like to stake with that validator, click the blue stake button, enter the amount of ‘Token’ that you would like to stake, and press the blue ‘Stake Token’ button and pay gas fees
