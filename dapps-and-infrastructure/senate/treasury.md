## Overview

The Treasury is a collection of tokens that the [Kujira Senate](./) uses to fund projects, partnerships, and other initiatives that benefit the community. It is replenished through the community fund, which accumulates 2% of network fees from gas and transactions on the Kuijra network's first-party dApps, as well as from revenue share on third-party Kujira dApps. These funds are transferred to the treasury through governance, ensuring that it has a sustainable source of funding over time.

As the Kuijra network's fees are paid using the assets being traded or bid on, the treasury is able to accumulate a diverse range of tokens. This gives it the flexibility to adapt to changes in market demand and remain resilient in the long term.
