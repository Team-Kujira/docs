# 💹 Price Chart and Charting Tools

## Overview

Another important aspect of the FIN experience is the price chart as well as FIN's accompanying charting tools which are located smack dab in the top center of the FIN user interface. FIN's price charts are supported by trading view and provide users with a variety of tools (on every FIN token pair) for scrolling through all past FIN price data, changing the bar widths, changing the graphical display, adding technical indicators, and a bevy of drawing and measuring tools, full screen mode, as well as the ability to save or copy chart images locally or automatically share them on Twitter.&#x20;

## FIN price charts

FIN price charts are similar to other trading view charts.

Overall trading activity over the course of a selected time period (default of 1 hour) is summarized and represented either as a green or red bar depending on whether there was more buy or sell demand in aggregate over that selected time period. Price changes are reflected over time.

The height of each bar represents the highest or lowest price that the asset was sold for over that time period. By varying the lengths of the bars, different aspects of trading activity can be observed. FIN allows various bar length options in minutes, various options in hours, and even day, week, and month options. Preferred bar lengths can be favorited to automatically display on the FIN price chart.

Furthermore, the bar type (from bars to candles, to connected lines, to shaded areas) can also be customized as well to help best intuit and understand asset price evolution over time.

Charts provide a substantial amount of information about buy and sell pressure from different entities including protocols, traders, accumulators, whales, etc. Across various situations, different time frames give distinct types of information about trading pairs. However, the FIN experience is as simple as the user wants it to be. There is no need to configure the price charts at all to simply perform trades.

Above the price chart, at the top of the FIN user interface, related information is displayed about the current exchange rate, the dollar value of the base asset, the 24 hour change in the pair exchange rate, the 24 hour high, the 24 hour low, and the 24 hour volume of the trading pair.&#x20;
