# 💰 Treasury

The Treasury was a collection of tokens that the [Kujira Senate](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md) used to fund projects, partnerships, and other initiatives that benefit the community. It was replenished through the community fund, which accumulates 2% of network fees from gas and transactions on the Kuijra network's first-party dApps, as well as from revenue share on third-party Kujira dApps. These funds were transferred to the treasury through governance, ensuring that it had a sustainable source of funding over time.

As the Kujira network's fees are paid using the assets being traded or bid on, the treasury was able to accumulate a diverse range of tokens. This gave it the flexibility to adapt to changes in market demand and remain resilient in the long term.
