# dApp Front Ends

## Overview

At Kujira, we are committed to maintaining the highest levels of quality and sustainability for our stakers through the use of innovative and effective technology, including dApps that contain sensitive information that we refer to as the "magic secret sauce" of our products and infrastructure. However, due to the sensitive nature of this information, we have decided to initially keep these dApps closed source.

That being said, we do have a long-term plan to gradually open-source these dApps over time. In the meantime, we have made a repository of all open-source materials available on our Github page at [https://github.com/Team-Kujira](https://github.com/Team-Kujira). In this section, we will focus specifically on the dApps that are being open-sourced as part of this process. &#x20;
